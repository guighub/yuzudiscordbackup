The only difference between them is how far out the open world renders,\nas that heavily affects performance. Everything else is exactly the same. If you are getting constant crashes in the open world, try the Normal version.\n\nThe recommended emulator is currently Ryujinx as you can completely eliminate all crashes by enabling the \"6GB DRAM\" and \"Ignore Missing Services\"\nsettings for the emulator. Yuzu does not currently have any equivalent settings, so you WILL eventully crash in the open world on Yuzu. The 4k option\nalso works just fine on Ryujinx, whereas on Yuzu it will either cause the open world to horribly misrender or crash instantly during load.\nIf using Ryujinx, keep the resolution scale at Native, as my mod will completely handle the resolution.\n\n**--FEATURES--**\n\n-Greatly increase draw distance quality in the open world and in general for all objects (for the High Open World Distance version)\n---NOTE: It will be a bit laggy when first loading into the open world because it is loading ALOT more all at once\n-Increase quality of all graphical effects to the normal max setting unreal engine uses for PC games (Bloom, depth of field, lens flares, ambient occlusion, etc)\n----NOTE: Depth of field has a small issue when going above 720p (the game's default resolution). DoF is only used in cutscenes, and in certain sections of certain cutscenes it may be slightly off for a second or 2 because it was originally configured with the 720p resolution in mind. You probably won't even notice it, but if you think that things are a little more blurry than they should be for certain parts of cutscenes that use DoF, thats why. Nothing I can do to fix it.\n-Enable higher quality Temporal Anti-Aliasing with some custom tuning by me to fix jagged edges and image stability issues while maintaining sharpness\n-Increase texture quality to the highest the game has available\n-Increase texture quality transition distance (no more obvious line of blurry texture transition ahead of you when on the bike)\n-Enable x16 Anisotropic Filtering to increase texture quality at farther distances\n-Greatly increase the quality and render distance of shadows, including self-shadows on characters\n-Increase hair rendering quality and enable hair to cast shadows in normal gameplay\n-Increase lighting and shading quality and light render distance\n-(Optional) Enable my own tuned per-object motion blur\n\n**--V2 CHANGES--**\n\n-Offer Normal and High Open World Distance presets\n-Optimized streaming pool size. Should no longer instant crash when trying to load into the open world on Yuzu.\n-Fixed depth of field not rendering in cutscenes at all\n-Tuned roughness of screen space reflecions (SSR). Now only objects that should have SSR will have it, and everything that has it won't look like a polished mirror. SSR is now enabled by default on all presets. Thanks to cucholix on the GBATemp forums for finding the fix!\n-Further improved the distance at which detailed contact shadows fade\n-Further increased the quality of character rendering. Characters should now render at their max possible quality at all times.\n-Slightly tuned Temporal Anti Aliasing to be a bit sharper with less ghosting and eliminate shimmering\n-Slightly tuned Motion Blur to now not have any artifacting around Travis when moving the camera while running\n-Cleaned up alot of unnecessary commands\n\n**Also checkout the FPS Unlocker mod above!**\n\n**Video Example**\n<https://youtu.be/NeEmMi4Ado0>","channel_id":"495758692495523854","author":{"id":"264615698884460544","username":"nikkmann","global_name":"NikkMann","avatar":"a_8d4983a1b4282c2bc2978095e482e221","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_d3da36040163ee0f9176dfe7ced45cdc","sku_id":"1144058522808614923"},"discriminator":"0","public_flags":512,"premium_type":2},"attachments":[{"id":"886720833865781309","filename":"NMH3GraphicsModV2.zip","size":52092,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/495758692495523854/886720833865781309/NMH3GraphicsModV2.zip?ex=65f75ca1&is=65e4e7a1&hm=c04864bdd19278b0ba555219868aa37bcfbb54fc13a4878a65025da9ac7c5474&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/495758692495523854/886720833865781309/NMH3GraphicsModV2.zip?ex=65f75ca1&is=65e4e7a1&hm=c04864bdd19278b0ba555219868aa37bcfbb54fc13a4878a65025da9ac7c5474&","content_type":"application/zip"}],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-09-12T21:12:01.343000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2021-09-12T22:54:15.672000+00:00","flags":0,"components":[],"hit":true}],[{"id":"886714351522828319","type":0,"content":"No

DoF is only available on certain cutscenes :/ Anyway, here is my newest draw distance 1 preset for 1440p and the WIP 60 fps patch by Kirby657Fan. It will only work for version 1.0.1 of the game. It actually doesn't have visual glitches anymore after restarting my computer, but it limits the whole game to 60 fps, including fights that had unlocked fps before. I asked him to look into that, maybe just unlock the whole game's framerate but we'll see. My yuzu mainline still crashes with the 60fps patch and draw distance 1, separate and together, but I'm at least able to load into the open world. Ryujinx runs like a dream though.

them.","channel_id":"495758692495523854","author":{"id":"264615698884460544","username":"nikkmann","global_name":"NikkMann","avatar":"a_8d4983a1b4282c2bc2978095e482e221","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_d3da36040163ee0f9176dfe7ced45cdc","sku_id":"1144058522808614923"},"discriminator":"0","public_flags":512,"premium_type":2},"attachments":[{"id":"886038265449291827","filename":"mods.zip","size":3232,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/495758692495523854/886038265449291827/mods.zip?ex=65f4e0f0&is=65e26bf0&hm=d5e2ee012ea0f4b9847c170ec4c774f5b64a8d69c9c27c19dc69291bc431de5e&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/495758692495523854/886038265449291827/mods.zip?ex=65f4e0f0&is=65e26bf0&hm=d5e2ee012ea0f4b9847c170ec4c774f5b64a8d69c9c27c19dc69291bc431de5e&","content_type":"application/zip"}],"embeds":[],"mentions":[{"id":"810344082781634561","username":"emily_yume","global_name":"Emily","avatar":"42e73699fe661492f36376884693bbde","avatar_decoration_data":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":256}],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-09-10T23:59:44.267000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"message_reference":{"channel_id":"495758692495523854","guild_id":"398318088170242053","message_id":"886021647365210112"},"hit":true}],[{"id":"886028922209329173","type":0,"content":"","channel_id":"495758692495523854","author":{"id":"216997042378113024","username":".ggspawn","global_name":"GG-Spawn","avatar":"bc26532da206bb9675bc9914dbac2de6","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_c3cffc19e9784f7d0b005eecdf1b566e","sku_id":"1212569433839636530"},"discriminator":"0","public_flags":512,"premium_type":0},"attachments":[{"id":"886028920036663296","filename":"unknown.png","size":68483,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/495758692495523854/886028920036663296/unknown.png?ex=65f4d83c&is=65e2633c&hm=078ba6af168a71ad55b006ef3cba0d82c781b6abeba5303d632a8e2279a76876&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/495758692495523854/886028920036663296/unknown.png?ex=65f4d83c&is=65e2633c&hm=078ba6af168a71ad55b006ef3cba0d82c781b6abeba5303d632a8e2279a76876&","width":1160,"height":732,"content_type":"image/png"}],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-09-10T23:22:36.676000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"hit":true}],[{"id":"886028322008596553","type":0,"content":"","channel_id":"495758692495523854","author":{"id":"216516074525425667","username":"suplink","global_name":"S

alright, if you could test these 4 presets out somewhat extensively and whichever one works best is what I'll upload as a new testbuild on youtube. On each folder, the first number is either a 1000 or -1. Thats the size of the streaming pool. I'm trying 1000 instead of 800 just to give the game a bit more wiggle room rendering wise and to see if it runs any better or worse. -1 makes it use unreal engine's default value instead, which I don't really know what that is but it makes the mod run about the same as 800 for me, so if that one doesn't have any issues I think -1 would be the value I'll stick with since its what unreal is built for. The second part of each folders name is either B1 or B0. This is whether uniformbufferpooling for the switch is enabled (1) or disabled (0). I honestly don't know what this does but the unreal documentation says to set it to 1 for more optimization and it came disabled by default with the game. I didn't notice any changes on my side with it enabled or disabled, but maybe it'll make things run better for other people. If not, I'll just set it back to 0.","channel_id":"495758692495523854","author":{"id":"264615698884460544","username":"nikkmann","global_name":"NikkMann","avatar":"a_8d4983a1b4282c2bc2978095e482e221","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_d3da36040163ee0f9176dfe7ced45cdc","sku_id":"1144058522808614923"},"discriminator":"0","public_flags":512,"premium_type":2},"attachments":[{"id":"885562315259396207","filename":"BufferTest.zip","size":9887,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/495758692495523854/885562315259396207/BufferTest.zip?ex=65f325ac&is=65e0b0ac&hm=139bdd141bec15332269bf093217dae25be1bd2b4698925f8234df513e179d73&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/495758692495523854/885562315259396207/BufferTest.zip?ex=65f325ac&is=65e0b0ac&hm=139bdd141bec15332269bf093217dae25be1bd2b4698925f8234df513e179d73&","content_type":"application/zip"}],"embeds":[],"mentions":[{"id":"810344082781634561","username":"emily_yume","global_name":"Emily","avatar":"42e73699fe661492f36376884693bbde","avatar_decoration_data":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":256}],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-09-09T16:28:28.967000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2021-09-09T16:30:48.946000+00:00","flags":0,"components":[],"hit":true}],[{"id":"885043495675523103","type":0,"content":"<@!810344082781634561> These will ideally be the final (or close to final) tests for stability. I've got all the graphical options dialed in exactly how I want them now. The number next to the \"r\" in the folder is the render pool size, and the number next to the \"s\" is the streaming pool size. If you could test them in the open world pls. My hypothesis is that no matter which render pool number you use, performance should stay mostly the same. It will be the changes in streaming numbers that'll really affect it. s630 is basically gonna look like the switch version. s650 is gonna look slightly better than the switch version up close but not at far distances. s800 should look the same as the mod has up until now. There's only one s630 folder because i expect performance on that one to be rock solid no matter the render pool size. Lmk how they go, thanks for all this.
