We started the projects in good faith, out of passion for Nintendo and its consoles and games, and were not intending to cause harm. But we see now that because our projects can circumvent Nintendo\u2019s technological protection measures and allow users to play games outside of authorized hardware, they have led to extensive piracy. In particular, we have been deeply disappointed when users have used our software to leak game content prior to its release and ruin the experience for legitimate purchasers and fans.\n\nWe have come to the decision that we cannot continue to allow this to occur. Piracy was never our intention, and we believe that piracy of video games and on video game consoles should end. Effective today, we will be pulling our code repositories offline, discontinuing our Patreon accounts and Discord servers, and, soon, shutting down our websites. We hope our actions will be a small step toward ending piracy of all creators\u2019 works.\n\nThank you for your years of support and for understanding our decision.","channel_id":"402298620671557633","author":{"id":"152912959075516416","username":"bunnei","global_name":"bunnei","avatar":"63c5a8e1a6acbd159b67e8215211165f","avatar_decoration_data":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"premium_type":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":true,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2024-03-04T19:22:01.097000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":1,"components":[],"hit":true}],[{"id":"1206002545156165642","type":0,"content":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfRjc9v0jls","channel_id":"402298620671557633","author":{"id":"98550512391036928","username":"flamboyantham","global_name":"Flamboyant Ham","avatar":"54f02b961fa019ea4974c4a2f4fe38d6","avatar_decoration_data":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"premium_type":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2024-02-10T22:23:33.209000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":5,"components":[],"hit":true}],[{"id":"1206002520883732480","type":0,"content":"@everyone The first Progress Report of 2024 and we've got some exciting news to share!\n\nM U L T I P R O C E S S\n\nThis touches so many parts of yuzu and accelerates our accuracy!\n\nWe also have so many graphical fixes, Android updates, and... frame generation?\n\nYou'll want to read more \ud83d\udc40\nThe yuzu January 2024 Progress Report is live:\nhttps://yuzu-emu.org/entry/yuzu-progress-report-jan-2024/","channel_id":"402298620671557633","author":{"id":"98550512391036928","username":"flamboyantham","global_name":"Flamboyant Ham","avatar":"54f02b961fa019ea4974c4a2f4fe38d6","avatar_decoration_data":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"premium_type":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[{"type":"link","url":"https://yuzu-emu.org/entry/yuzu-progress-report-jan-2024/","title":"Progress Report January 2024 \u00b7 yuzu","description":"Welcome to 2024, yuz-ers!
