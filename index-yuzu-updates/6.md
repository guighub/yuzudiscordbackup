> 
>  - User can now choose Vsync mode on Graphics section, setting will show Vsync method that available on GPU driver used by systems. FIFO mode is responsible for Vsync on, FIFO Relaxed option is responsible for Vsync fast, Mailbox mode is most preferred for most smooth experience, and Immediate mode is responsible for Vsync off. Please note that Yuzu will switch to Mailbox mode when user unlocks framerate. Due to lacking mailbox mode on Intel and AMD GPUs if you unlock framerate on these GPUs it will switch to Immediate mode.

> ```- Add an option to enable compute pipelines for Intel proprietary. [#10181]
> 
>  - We disabled the intel compute pipeline with PR #10110 to resolve the crashes that occured during the boot of various games. However doing this appears to cause rendering issues in games like Pokemon Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Since the intel Driver remain broken, we have added an option to enable the compute pipeline for games that require it to render properly. The option is only visible in per-game config.

>  - Greatly improved romfs mod loading speed in general. We have measure the rom fs loading speed in Fire Emblem Engage and Animal crossing, both of which are known to have an enormous amount of files in it. Fire Emblem Engage's single mod loading time has been reduced from 150 second to just 3 second, while Animal Crossing's 8 mod loading time has been reduced from 267 second to 10 second.```
