> Early Access 2254:
> 
> - Fixes a softlock during boot with Dead or Alive Xtreme 3: Scarlet when multicore is enabled.
> - Fixes several crashes that can occur in-game with Pokémon Sword & Shield.

## Blinkhawk (blinkhawk) 12/04/2021 20:07 

> Early Access 2272:
> 
> - Fixes potential crashes on NVIDIA/Vulkan while playing Pokemon BD/SP. It should also ensure the bugs of missing/broken graphics and LSD(rainbow) effects don't happen again (if they do after this version, I'll cry)
> - We are now doing a lot more heavy compile optimizations on our EA builds to make the emulator run smoother. This will be added to mainline builds as well once it's known that all the optimizations are safe.

## Blinkhawk (blinkhawk) 12/05/2021 12:18 

> Early Access 2273:
> 
> - We have gone back to SSE2 base optimizations because it seems there's still users with over 15 year old CPUs and we have not given an appropriate warning that we will drop compatibility for them. (Note that we don't explicitly support them). We will discuss this further and likely make an announcement. The rest of the optimizations we applied which made big part of the boost, will remain.
> 
> About AVX support: we are not planning to do it in the main application (dynarmic generates AVX  and further already when needed) As A. it has not shown to make any difference vs SSE4.2 nor B. Intel does not add AVX on Pentium and Celeron series and C. we can always do dynamic code if it turns out beneficial. D. we try to make the GPU do the heavy vectorial stuffs.

## Blinkhawk (blinkhawk) 12/06/2021 19:39 

> Note because some people got confused:
> 
> We are discussing to compile yuzu using SSE4.2 as minimum instead SSE2. This means that 0.8% of our users (about 7k from those with telemetry on) would lose support only on mainline and EA auto updaters. yuzu will still be able to be built for older PCs and we are exploring if we add alternative builds here: https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu-mainline/releases. This is not final but we'll look into how can we get everybody happy.

## Blinkhawk (blinkhawk) 12/17/2021 16:19 

> For AMD users:
> 
> We have verified that the latest version of AMDVLK has fixed the "transform feedback" feature in Vulkan. This features is used by some games like Xenoblade games (grass), Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze (fur) and Pokemon Touranment DX (Character models).
> 
> For the time being this is fixed in Linux. For Windows, it will take some time to reach their driver releases. We will let you know when the windows driver has the fixes.

## Blinkhawk (blinkhawk) 12/18/2021 16:12 

> Early Access 2326:
> 
> - Fixed Shadows & Moveable Sand on the third temple in The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword on Vulkan.
> - Fixed lighting in Xenoblade 2 on Vulkan. I should remind everyone including NVIDIA users that Vulkan is faster than OpenGL on Xenoblade 2. For AMD users, you'll have to wait for a future driver update so the grass is fixed.
> - Fixed lighting in Bioshock games on Vulkan.

> - Fixes a crash that occurs on Intel Vulkan drivers when scaling MSAA textures
> 
> We also want to wish all of our yuzers a Merry Christmas and happy holidays!

## Morph (morph_.) 01/10/2022 02:25

## bunnei (bunnei) 01/16/2022 09:25 

> Early Access 2402:
> 
> - Fixes crashes that occur in Pokémon Sword & Shield after extended periods of gameplay.
> - Introduces a new version of the VRAM Garbage Collector. With this, we calculate memory usage in an adaptive way, being more permissive on high-end GPUs, and more aggressive on low-end GPUs. This should improve games that heavily use ASTC textures (e.g. Astral Chain), improve memory management on iGPUs, and mitigate GPU-related crashes on lower-end systems.

### 932424287711813703
## epicboy (epicboy.) 01/17/2022 00:01 

> Early Access 2404:

### 936375937728135240
## epicboy (epicboy.) 01/27/2022 21:43 

> Early Access 2439:
> 
> - Fixes softlocks in `Final Fantasy 8` and `Pokemon Legends: Arceus` that occurred due to kernel thread migration between the emulated guest cores.
> - Adds a buffer cache optimization to reduce stream buffer allocations, fixing a memory spike and crash in `Pokemon Legends: Arceus`.
> - Implements VMNMX shader selectors, used by `Pokemon Legends: Arceus`.
> 
> NOTE: `Pokemon Legends: Arceus` makes use of Transform Feedback for many character models, this technique is still unsupported on Windows AMD Vulkan drivers. Unfortunately, this means AMD users should use OpenGL or switch to Linux until this feature is properly supported on the Windows Vulkan drivers.
> 
> There also remains random vertex explosions in `Pokemon Legends: Arceus` that are currently being investigated.

### 936754482174369802
## epicboy (epicboy.) 01/28/2022 22:47 

> Early Access 2441:
> 
> - Explicitly adds the `Xfb` execution mode to SPIR-V shaders when Transform Feedback is used. Fixes Transform Feedback on AMD Vulkan drivers. 
> 
> This resolves some long standing AMD Vulkan specific graphical issues such as missing character models in `Pokken Tournament` and `Pokemon Legends Arceus`, the corrupt terrain grass in `Xenoblade Chronicles`, fur in `Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze`, along with countless other usages of transform feedback.

### 936790238909571173
## epicboy (epicboy.) 01/29/2022 01:09

## Blinkhawk (blinkhawk) 01/31/2022 13:43 

> Early Access 2450:

## Blinkhawk (blinkhawk) 01/31/2022 22:32

> 
> - Fix some full freezes on Vulkan under certain strange conditions. This is known to affect mostly iGPUs (Intel & AMD) on Super Mario 64 Port (nouveau driver), Super Mario 3D All stars (doesn't render currently).
> - It's not known if it fixes freezes in PLA or not but let us know in case it does. likely not as the reports seem to be a kernel issue.

> 
> - Adds "Extended memory layout" support. This is a memory mode for a Switch with 6GB of DRAM. The main use case for this (in yuzu) is for mods that require more memory than Switch natively supports, such as for higher resolution/increased texture size. This setting can be found in the yuzu Configuration "General" tab.
