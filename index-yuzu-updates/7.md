> ```- Reintroduces Y.F.C. Reactive Flushing as an option. [#10155]
>  - It fixes various issues, such as
>   - Bayonetta 2's shadow would not render correctly.
>   - Save data Thumbnails for Xenoblade Definitive Edition and Xenoblade Chronicles 3.
>   - The lighting in Xenoblade games in place such as Frontier Village from  Xenoblade Definitive Edition and Tora's house from Xenoblade Chronicles 2.
>   - Enhances performance for games that heavily rely on buffers, such as Monster Hunter Rise.
>   - Thumbnails and in-game photos from various games, including camera photos in Astral Chain and partially from Luigi's Mansion 3's thumbnails.
>   - Reduces the occurrence of vertex explosions in Pokemon Violet/Scarlet.
>   - Enable high accuracy to fully utilize async buffers in Vulkan, resulting in improved performance specifically in this mode.
>  - Additionally, fixed some potential deadlocks caused by recent changes to the memory manager.```

> ```- Add an option to enable compute pipelines for Intel proprietary. [#10181]
> 
>  - We disabled the intel compute pipeline with PR #10110 to resolve the crashes that occured during the boot of various games. However doing this appears to cause rendering issues in games like Pokemon Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Since the intel Driver remain broken, we have added an option to enable the compute pipeline for games that require it to render properly. The option is only visible in per-game config.
> 
> - Improve layer fs mod loading speed. [#10183]
> 
>  - Greatly improved romfs mod loading speed in general. We have measure the rom fs loading speed in Fire Emblem Engage and Animal crossing, both of which are known to have an enormous amount of files in it. Fire Emblem Engage's single mod loading time has been reduced from 150 second to just 3 second, while Animal Crossing's 8 mod loading time has been reduced from 267 second to 10 second.

>   - We have identified missing weapon menu image in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom caused by the Asynchronous Shader Building option. However the game saves the weapon image in cache storage as soon as you pick up weapon or fuse the weapon. This cause to save broken output of the image when asynchronous shader enabled and remain broken until you pick up again. To fix this issue we have added an item to reset the cache storage in the remove items section that appear when you right click on the game in the game list. With asynchronous shader disabled and using this item, the weapon image should display correctly without clearing the shader.
