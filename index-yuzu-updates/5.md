>  - This option helps GPUs to reach high clock speeds while running yuzu, providing a 40%+ performance boost on RDNA2 AMD GPUs, in either Windows or Linux. NVIDIA gets a ~5% boost. While this is a safe default option, it will make the system consume more power, reducing battery life on mobile devices, and cause renderdoc captures to be unusable, so if needed, an option to disable it has been added to the Advanced tab in Graphics settings.
