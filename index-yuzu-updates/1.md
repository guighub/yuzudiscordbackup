> - Significantly reduces memory usage in Pokemon Sword & Shield (Several additional fixes are being worked on tho improve this further)
> 
> Mouse changes:
> - Changes the mouse panning hotkey to `CTRL & F9` to reduce the occurrences of accidental pressing. (This can be reconfigured from the General/Hotkeys section)
> - Mouse will no longer be auto hidden upon enabling mouse panning, users must also enable `Hide mouse on inactivity` from the Configure/General settings tab for this behavior
> - Mouse panning will now auto disable when you close the emulator
> - Controller mapping now allows you to use mouse thumb buttons (Forward and backward) for input mapping (Note: Previous mouse mapping needs to be updated for the new mouse click indexing)

> This setting is mainly for debugging performance gains or regressions, and as such should not be enabled for regular gameplay.
> 
> Find this option in Configure/General/Debug. This can be enabled/disabled at runtime.

> In liu of an imminent new release, we are changing our default settings and eliminating some options.
> 
> Default settings will now be set on the recommended settings. As an example, we reformed CPU options to be more consistant and easier to use. Now we have Auto (some "unsafe" options active that are not known to affect any games). which is the default option, leaving it as it is good for players but for homebrew developers we suggest "Accurate".
> 
> We have removed the MULTICORE/ASYNC toggles as this are rarely used anymore for gaming. This options were created when such features were experimental, now-a-days they are a lot more stable.
> 
> We have added a GPU Accuracy toggle. By default the setting is High as this is the best option for most games on accuracy level. We, however, understand that not everyone has a modern gaming machine that can afford that, so we allow changing it to Normal. For most games from High to Normal, means that some graphical effects will be broken such as particles in botw, SMO. Some games like UE4 games, may need High to avoid vertex explosions. With this toggle, we allow you to compare and decide what is best for you.
> 
> Please let us know your thoughts and feedback on this options. We hope the new scheme is more of your liking.
> 
> Furthermore, stay tuned today, we got more news to share.

> Developer Note:
> 
> We have identified issues on AMD GCN1-4 (RX 500s 400s 300s 200s series) on Skyward Sword HD on Vulkan. This issue also happens on BotW and AoC. Please use OpenGL in the meantime. We are currently looking at it and narrowed down so far to a single spot. Users of AMD Vega or RDNA1/RDNA2 (any modern AMD GPU) are not affected.
> 
> EDIT: ~~Seems RDNA is also affected. Only vega isn't.~~ Wrong report.
> 
> EDIT2: After looking deep into it, we came into the conclussion that it may be an scheduling issue with driver's generated shader code. This kind of issues are very hard to workaround. Sadly, you'll have to use OGL for those games until either AMD fixes the driver or you use Linux and RADV.
