> Early Access 1080 -> 1088:
>  - Project Mjolnir Part 3: Thanks to the joint effort of <@!261896330522263556> and <@!135104364976013313>, we were graced with Part 3 of the Input rewrite efforts. Changes include: 
>    - Working controller profiles
>    - Fixes to performance issues seen on some controllers with rumble enabled 
>    - Fixes to games where rumble did not work and overall more accurate rumble emulation
>    - Various other input related quality of life changes.
> 
> - Improvements to GPU synchronization: Thanks to <@!152912959075516416>, the emulated GPU code now sees more accurate synchronization mechanisms with async GPU/Multicore enabled. These fixes allow Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario Galaxy to boot (although they do not render anything yet), and seems to fix crashes in Luigi's Mansion 3. 
> (Note: due to the elusiveness of async/multicore bugs, it is difficult to confirm if any other crashing/softlocking has been fixed)
> 
> - <@!102965274898083840> implemented FCMP immediate + register variant and partially implemented texture cube array shadow. These fix various rendering issues in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity
> - CPU's with 12+ threads will see more threads allocated for async shaders compilation
