> Hey folks - PokÃ©mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! are now playable in game in the latest Canary build of yuzu, on release day!
> 
> Things are still a bit early, and as such there are a few compromises and issues that need to be worked out. In order to get ingame, you will need to:
> * Grab the latest Canary build, e.g. <https://yuzu-emu.org/downloads/>
> * Dump and use your NAND and keys from your 5.1 console, following our quickstart guide: <https://yuzu-emu.org/help/quickstart/>
> * Follow the instructions here to set the correct system settings: <https://yuzu-emu.org/game/pokemon-lets-go-eevee/> or <https://yuzu-emu.org/game/pokemon-lets-go-pikachu/>
> 
> At this point, this is just a preview, do not expect things to work great. But we are working on it and it will improve quickly. Enjoy!

> @everyone Happy New Year! We just released a new version of the yuzu installer. We **strongly encourage you to manually reinstall yuzu** by downloading the latest installer from: <https://yuzu-emu.org/downloads/>. Just run the installer and click "Update".
> **Why?** The newest version of the installer fixes issues with automatic updates. It also fixes the taskbar icon on Windows for Early Access.
> **But seriously, whyyy??** Typically, we push installer updates automatically. However, due to a bug in our previous release, users stuck on the old version will never get installer updates. This has been fixed going forward.
> Thank you for your understanding and sorry for the noise/inconvenience!
