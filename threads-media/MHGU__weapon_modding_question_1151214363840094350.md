> Hello,
> 
> I'm trying to change the texture of a weapon in mhgu by an existing one. For example, changing the basic iron sword by the Santoku Reaver.
> I extracted the romfs folder of the game and changing the textures using Kuriimu2.
> The screenshot below shows, for example, the texture for weapon nÂ°1 (of the greatswords), which corresponds to the Iron sword.
> You can see that the texture has been correctly modified by the Santoku Reaver.
> However, when I put the romfs folder modified in the modding folder the texture is not applied.
> Does anyone have any idea what's causing the problem ?
> 
> I'm new to modding, so thanks in advance !
