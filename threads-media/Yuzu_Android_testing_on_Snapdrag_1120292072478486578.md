> Next up, CrossCode. I swear with the fast memory update this game runs at 50 FPS but screen recording really ate a lot of those yummy framerates.

> Bleak Sword DX! A cute but also haunting newly released banger by Devolver Digital for PC and Nintendo Switch only at the moment. Doesn't run all too well you can feel the stutters. I believe this game runs at 60 FPS on the Nintendo Switch whereas it doesn't even hit 30 here.
> 
> Funnily enough this game, despite being newly released, DOES render perfectly on Skyline, but Skyline doesn't run it THAT much better either, only about 44 FPS but that's still way better than 27.

> Persona 5 Royal running perfectly with no rendering issues from what I can see and even the cutscenes work unlike in Skyline, but Skyline still has better framerates (30 FPS at 1x resolution or even 60 FPS with maximum display refresh rate toggle enabled).

> Here's the big one, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild! Actually my phone was throttling by the time I thought about recording the screen. I swear, at first I was actually getting a decent 23 ish FPS and was so mesmerized by it, I was testing and testing but then I got reminded that I had to record my screen lmfao but by that time my phone was at 43 ⁰C. Still not bad, for a 4 year old chipset!
