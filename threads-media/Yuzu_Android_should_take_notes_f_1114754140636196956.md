> I found this very interesting as a concept of touch controls for Yuzu Android, I'm using Steam Link to play SSHD on my phone through yuzu pc, and with Steam Input I made my screen mimic a touchpad, combined with the mouse to gyro already available on the emulator I was able to achieve a camera that acts very similar to native Android games, especially in this game because it lets me use gyroscope to fully control the camera, yuzu Android doesn't work on my phone, so I don't know if something like this is already available but if not, it definitely should!

> I have camera plus sword control at the same time without using any motion controls or having to keep any button pressed to use one or the other, this is also great for steam deck users since you can use your right stick for sword control, and the right touchpad as the camera providing a better experience than original hardware.

> It's truly amusing!

> It works wonderfully in games like Metroid Prime, just like native Android shooters

> There are existing Android apps that have this functionality and would work with Yuzu Android, but they aren't very trustworthy IMO.

> I know at least one requires root access, another works rootless but is most likely sending telemetry to a datafarm. Having a way of configuring your own touch controls seems like a good feature idea for a future update once everything else is sorted
