> Game plays the introduction "Harran" video upon boot, but won't progress after that. My phone heats up and the game stays at a locked 30 black screened, but nothing happens when I wait for it. When accuracy is set to normal, the output is upside down. Other than that, there's no change in performance when any setting is changed.
