> hello everyone! I created a ui design concept for Yuzu and wanted to make it how i would imagine yuzu to be. It includes not only a whole new interface, but also actual features:
> - **Search Engine**: Search from your installed games
> - **Library**: Browse all your games, detected games will automatically show up or you can manually add
> - **Favorites**: Set your preferred games to access them faster
> - **Multiple Users**: Create a user to save your favorite games, game time, search history, saves, settings, etc...
> - **In-Game Navbar**: A floating navbar that you can open in-game with a key to bring the same options as usual 
> 
> I of course tried to put a bit of the switch's ui style to make this. Hope you like it!

> This is really cool, hopefully you can convince the team to implement it at some point! But they are probably busy doing lots of other things right now I imagine
