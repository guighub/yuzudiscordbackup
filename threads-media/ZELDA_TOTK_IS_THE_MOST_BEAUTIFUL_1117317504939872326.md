> this might easily be the most beautiful game I have every played, visually. Not exagerrating, I've played forbidden west, death stranding, and elden ring on max graphics on my pc, I have been playing TOTK almost exclusively on my pc so im not "switch biased" or wtvr. This game is just stunning

> i dont think they suck, but yeah elden ring is by far my favorite of those, i just mentioned them because they're two games that are graphically really impressive and very beatiful in many areas. Even then  elden ring i still think is the best looking game out of all of them, that first time looking at the world after exiting the first dungeon or going to the golden city, maaaan those visuals are just stunning

> A game must have good gameplay (1st in priority) and a decent story (2nd in priority, but can be omitted as not all games have stories) for me to like it. Neither Horizon: Forbidden West nor Death Stranding have either of those, and Elden Ring at least has good gameplay but still not as good as Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.

> It depends, on how addictive a game actually is. Not saying Persona 5 Royal is addictive however; I haven't even played that game yet so I wouldn't know. But thing is, you'll *rarely* see anyone complain about the length of a game no matter what the game is. I personally haven't.
> 
> I can excuse long playtime only if the game's gameplay is addictive enough to justify it, but even then there is a threshold that must not be crossed. For example: Katana ZERO is one of my most favorite games of all time and I do wish it was longer than 5.5 hours, but *even I* wouldn't want my beloved game to be over 12 hours long as that'd make it too repetitive.
