> What did you do to get it running <@278170962749554689> ? The game is just a black screen for me. I already spoke with some support guys, and my phone meets the minimum requirements. I can run it on skyline, but not in yuzu.

> I haven't installed the custom drivers not sure if this will affect none emulation games. so I have been holding off on that end. Thought that was the issue, unless it's exclusive to yuzu. But let me rather wait and see what the Guru's have in stock to remedy this.
