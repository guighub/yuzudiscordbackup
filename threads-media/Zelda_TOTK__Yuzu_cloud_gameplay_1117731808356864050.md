> Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom cloud play test. 1080p 60FPS mod. OS: Linux Mint, emulator: Yuzu EA for Linux.
> Gameplay test using cheap 7$ total cost VPS from https://maximumsettings.com/ (the prices on the website are displayerd in CAD, 10 CAD = 7,45 USD).
> I was really suprised how smooth it works on low cost VPS with GPU. In my opinion the quality is better than Nintendo Switch console. What do you think?
> Now I can play my favourite Zelda game just using my mobile. Even playing on any old/cheap smartphone is possible using this method. 😁 
> The only requirement is good internet connection. I was connected from EU location with the Canada server and still all worked fine.
