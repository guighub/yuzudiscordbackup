> Hey all! Recently while playing Tears of the Kingdom I remembered that Steam's Big Picture Mode (a simplified UI which is meant to support big TVs and other bigger monitors when used with a controller) is a thing. Curious about how a controller-only UI for yuzu would look like, I created this mockup based on the original Switch UI and some references I saw online (The Steam Deck also played a role)!

> Some info about the design choices: I wanted to keep most functionality that is available with one or two clicks, stuff like graphics settings etc. This UI mode is meant to be used when sitting back and enjoying games, so the only way to adjust settings is to head back to the normal yuzu mode via the bottom left yuzu icon. The game folders and favorites made most sense in a grid layout, since the user will most likely view this from further away, and general information or quick settings could be shown in a pop-up when pressing the `+`-button.

> The loading screen is just my own interpretation because I find the default switch loading screen to be a little boring 😂
