> NEO: The World Ends with you, updated to the latest version, only goes in game with the 615.50 proprietary driver instead of Turnip. It is not running at a playable framerate even when the screen isn't being recorded, and it still has graphical glitches.

> Risk of Rain 2 only shows signs of life when it is updated, but it does not render anything, no matter what. Sad.

> Here's a classic, Super Mario Odyssey (base game). I used Lost Kingdom partly because I thought it would make for a nice benchmark, and partly because I think it looks nice. Super Mario Odyssey may have seen a performance improvement on an outdated phone like mine in Cascade Kingdom as tested by other people, but it sure as heck does not run any better in Lost Kingdom.

> Saving the best one for last, perhaps the game that has seen the biggest improvement in performance, is also one of the hottest games on the Nintendo Switch, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, updated to its latest version.
> 
> When I am not recording I easily get 27 FPS on average. And when I am I get some dips to the 20's, as shown in the video. Impressive regardless, I am a fan of what I am seeing.
