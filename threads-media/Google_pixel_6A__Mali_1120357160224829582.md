> Performance wise I was excited when I saw upwards of 60fps in the hub and 30-40 in world 1 sometimes higher, at least in the starting area where I have already built shader cache but the problem is im having trouble recreating the performance, when I start up again I'm noticing more like 20ish frames in the hub world and about the same in world one, I did take a video of my first attempt because for some reason my phone is telling me it cant save screenshots so I have to spam just to get a few but I do have some so ill share them and a link to the video.

> Note: I wonder if maybe clearing shaders then recaching and reloading might bring back the performance I was getting here. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jAwIMoIuwNLJnWSICtA15q9pGeI2fEL-/view?usp=sharing and if sharing links to videos is not aloud please let me know, i read the rules and didn't see anything but maybe I'm just blind, also sorry for the small screen in my recording.

> Don't expect much perf in Mali yet. It has the big issue that it does not support BCn textures natively. That means they must be decoded and as decoded they generate more cache misses

> My phone was more willing to take screenshots today, I tried out the disable fxaa - V2 mod by by theboy181, it seemly led to slight performance increase but with with what blinkhawk stated above its hard to tell, I'll upload some other levels and try out some other games

Used all the same settings as listed above (no mods) but will try again tomorrow by clearing cache and hopefully I'll be able to make it in game but sadly I must sleep for work 💤 (cleared cache before I went to sleep last night and still crashing after logo so rip)
