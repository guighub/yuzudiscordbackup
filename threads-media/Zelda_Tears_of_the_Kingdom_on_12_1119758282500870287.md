> Using the standard fps modpack with fixes and reshade. I am gettting 50 fps. fsr sharpening 50%, 2x resolution, uncompressed textures at 16x AA with the amd filter. I could turn fsr down i suppose but so far messing with all settings and youtube presets and what people think is "right" this is mine. 
> 
> Using bluelegacy preset and modified. This is hdr on, saturation lessened, dark colours lessened from colour correction, a little gamma turned down, a little bit more contrast. Also forgot that i turned the depth of view curve all the way out, or focus curve i believe is the actual setting cause i hated the blurred far vision. its just not realistic

> it might be a little dark but i prefer this than the blah standard game.
