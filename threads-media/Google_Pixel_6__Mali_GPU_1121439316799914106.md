> Performance wise on this resolution the game runs pretty much perfectly playable, it dropped FPS on the screenshots when I took them, but it's mostly running between 45+ to 60 except on the most effect heavy moments when it drops to around 38, on 720p/1080p it has quite a bit of stuttering, but it's even then it can probably be considered playable to some, haven't tried 540p/810p yet nor did I try turning Async shaders on.
> have some screenshots, I recorded a video but I can't upload it cause I don't have nitro and it's a bit heavy, when recording gameplay tho, framerate dropped to 30 on the lowest and 45 at it's highest.
> Completed the first chapter of the game with no issues.
