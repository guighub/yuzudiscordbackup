> Too early to tell I haven't tried many things but it's running stable things like aether and half life 2 with the launcher very great. Switch emu is young so it's early to tell but Pokemon run very promising in Skyline and I could run Brilliant Diamond in yuzu today with 30 fps docked in the latest build and using 1.3.0 update which I patched with yanu. Also I heard something that might improved my performance but I need to test before I can comment on that
