[#10398]\n\n \n  - Adds a new setting to recompress ASTC textures, currently supporting BC1 and BC3 formats (Found in Graphics > Advanced Graphics). \n\n\n   - BC1 provides lower quality textures, but saves 8X more memory than Uncompressed. BC1 is the recommended format for 2GB and AMD igpu users. (In internal tests, a GTX 750 2GB was able to achieve playable speeds in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom with 0.5 scaling and BC1 recompression). Note that Bayonetta 3, Metroid Prime Remastered, Fire Emblem Engage will look very bad with BC1 recompression.\n\n\n   - BC3 provide medium quality textures, while saving 4x more memory than Uncompressed. This option doesn't produce a significant downgrade of texture quality compared to BC1, and is the recommended option for 4gb ~ 8gb users.\n\n\n- Limit device access memory for integrated devices to 4 GB. [#10411]\n\n\n - Prevent VRAM usage from filling up in integrated devices like steam deck.\n\n\n- Remove auditing calls in k_memory_block_manager.  [#10417]\n\n\n - Improves average performance in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Reported to help Steam Deck users, but results may vary between systems.```","channel_id":"668532415257509958","author":{"id":"482000349297639434","username":"gidoly","global_name":"gidoly","avatar":"8912c67257df0c9c4e5bf9fe83f63b1b","avatar_decoration_data":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"premium_type":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2023-05-24T20:14:14.948000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":1,"components":[],"hit":true}],[{"id":"1111019793596821624","type":0,"content":"<:earlyaccess:962107214582128671> Early Access 3609\n```-  Revert wrong acceleration assumption in texture cache.
