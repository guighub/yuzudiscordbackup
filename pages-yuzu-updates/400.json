[#9535]\n  \n - Adds Geometry passthrough emulation for AMD/Intel GPUs.\n\n  - Fixes some vertex explosions on  AMD/Intel GPUs with games such as Nier Automata The End of YoRHa Edition, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: Black order, Pokemon Legend Arceus.\n\n- Adds several fixes that would benifit Intel GPUs.\n\n- Adds option to force boost clock with GPU on Configure --> Graphic --> Graphic Advance and games properties. [#9552]\n \n - This option helps GPUs to reach high clock speeds while running yuzu, providing a 40%+ performance boost on RDNA2 AMD GPUs, in either Windows or Linux. NVIDIA gets a ~5% boost. While this is a safe default option, it will make the system consume more power, reducing battery life on mobile devices, and cause renderdoc captures to be unusable, so if needed, an option to disable it has been added to the Advanced tab in Graphics settings.\n\n  - Please note that it might degrade performance when user already forced boost clock with other third party programs.\n\n- Fixes new pipeline cache implemented by PR #9527 would invalidate on on each load due to wronng header size.

[#9527]\n\n - Adds Use 'Vulkan Pipleline cache' option on Configure --> Graphic\n--> Graphic Advance and games properties.\n\n - Enabling this option will create a separate Vulkan pipeline cache per-vendor, separate from yuzu's driver-level previous one. This option mainly serves for AMD GPUs on Windows, which rebuilds shader on each game boot due to cache size limits imposed by the driver. Expect much improved boot times on games with many shaders. The usual safeguard limitation of having to rebuild the cache once after driver updates still stands.\n\n - Reduces shader stutter cause by shader caching on overall games with both option enabled and disabled. Difference is most noticable with Koei games and Xenoblade chronicles 3.\n\n- Implement Cached Writes, use fastmem for reading GPU memory and eliminate old codes. [#9559]\n \n - This change reduces time spent reading data from CPU to GPU and invalidation overhead. Improves performance on overall games.\n\n - Fixes Pokemon Scarlet/Violet rendering with GPU normal accuracy.\n\n- Removes HLE'd macro that not properly RE'd. [#9564]\n\n - Fixes Graphical regression with Xenoblade Chronicles 3 which would cause particles to not render.```","channel_id":"668532415257509958","author":{"id":"482000349297639434","username":"gidoly","global_name":"gidoly","avatar":"8912c67257df0c9c4e5bf9fe83f63b1b","avatar_decoration_data":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"premium_type":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2023-01-06T21:53:12.768000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":1,"components":[],"hit":true}]]}
