BC1 is the recommended format for 2GB and AMD igpu users. (In internal tests, a GTX 750 2GB was able to achieve playable speeds in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom with 0.5 scaling and BC1 recompression).\n\n   - BC3 provide medium quality textures, while saving 4x more memory than Uncompressed. This option doesn't produce a significant downgrade of texture quality compared to BC1, and is the recommended option for 4gb ~ 8gb users.\n\n \n - Texture and buffer cache memory usage and garbage collection have been tuned to be more accommodating for ASTC transcoding on systems with less VRAM. This also adds a usage cap based on the resolution scale for cards with very large amounts of memory, which should help prevent slowdowns when memory fills up and menu stuttering on Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. (Garbage collection removes textures/buffers from memory which are no longer in use, reducing memory/VRAM usage.)\n\n \n - The above changes apply to all games that use ASTC textures, including Astral Chain, Bayonetta 3, Metroid Prime Remastered, Fire Emblem Engage and The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom. Note that Bayonetta 3, Metroid Prime Remastered, Fire Emblem Engage will look very bad with BC1 recompression.```","channel_id":"668532415257509958","author":{"id":"482000349297639434","username":"gidoly","global_name":"gidoly","avatar":"8912c67257df0c9c4e5bf9fe83f63b1b","avatar_decoration_data":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"premium_type":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2023-05-21T21:26:43.691000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-05-22T03:24:03.125000+00:00","flags":1,"components":[],"hit":true}],[{"id":"1109749863614251008","type":0,"content":"<:earlyaccess:962107214582128671> Early Access 3600\n```- Move fence wait on separate thread.

[#10181]\n\n - We disabled the intel compute pipeline with PR #10110 to resolve the crashes that occured during the boot of various games. However doing this appears to cause rendering issues in games like Pokemon Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Since the intel Driver remain broken, we have added an option to enable the compute pipeline for games that require it to render properly. The option is only visible in per-game config.\n\n- Improve layer fs mod loading speed. [#10183]\n\n - Greatly improved romfs mod loading speed in general. We have measure the rom fs loading speed in Fire Emblem Engage and Animal crossing, both of which are known to have an enormous amount of files in it. Fire Emblem Engage's single mod loading time has been reduced from 150 second to just 3 second, while Animal Crossing's 8 mod loading time has been reduced from 267 second to 10 second.\n\n- Add option to calibrate option.
