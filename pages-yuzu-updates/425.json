[#9527]\n\n - Adds Use 'Vulkan Pipleline cache' option on Configure --> Graphic\n--> Graphic Advance and games properties.\n\n - Enabling this option will create a separate Vulkan pipeline cache per-vendor, separate from yuzu's driver-level previous one. This option mainly serves for AMD GPUs on Windows, which rebuilds shader on each game boot due to cache size limits imposed by the driver. Expect much improved boot times on games with many shaders. The usual safeguard limitation of having to rebuild the cache once after driver updates still stands.\n\n\n- Adds option to force boost clock with GPU on Configure --> Graphic --> Graphic Advance and games properties. [#9552]\n \n- This option helps GPUs to reach high clock speeds while running yuzu, providing a 40%+ performance boost on RDNA2 AMD GPUs, in either Windows or Linux. NVIDIA gets a ~5% boost. While this is a safe default option, it will make the system consume more power, reducing battery life on mobile devices, and cause renderdoc captures to be unusable, so if needed, an option to disable it has been added to the Advanced tab in Graphics settings.```","channel_id":"668532415257509958","author":{"id":"482000349297639434","username":"gidoly","global_name":"gidoly","avatar":"8912c67257df0c9c4e5bf9fe83f63b1b","avatar_decoration_data":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"premium_type":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2023-01-05T07:02:02.212000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":1,"components":[],"hit":true}],[{"id":"1060075470240108544","type":0,"content":"<:earlyaccess:962107214582128671> Early Access 3279\n```- Fixes performance regression caused by rebase commit.
