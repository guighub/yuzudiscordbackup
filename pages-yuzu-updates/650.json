[#8508]\n * Merge \"Limit speed percent\" option with \"Frame rate cap\" option. CTRL + U hotkey will function same as before, most important user facing difference would be that now the user can set a game speed with percentage values. You can either slow down or speed up gameplay with this setting as long as the specific game allows it. If the game supports dynamic FPS it will adjust refresh rate instead. And highly requested feature, now we can apply higher game speed/refresh rate on boot. Game speed and refresh rate value on boot will be decided by percentage value you set. CTRL + U can still be used while you set the percentage value in case you want to speed up only certain sections of the game.\n- Update some services to 14.0.0+.
