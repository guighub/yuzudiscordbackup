# The Yuzu Discord Archive
This is a backup of a few important channels from the Yuzu Discord server, the backup was started a few days after the server went into lockdown and was completed around March 9th, 2024. The server has now been deleted and is not longer accessible outside of archives like these.

Almost every game mod sent in the *game-mods* and *media* channels are present in this archive, exceptions being random messages and attachments that were deleted by users during the backup.

All attachments are hosted on an AWS bucket and cannot be found in this repository since all files combined is over 60GB.

## "tools" folder
This contains the Python scripts I used to scrape the files and messages from Discord and reformat them into Markdown, I don't recommend using them as they were written very hastily and won't be able to pull messages from the Yuzu Discord since it's been deleted.
