> **No More Heroes 3 Graphics Mod**
> 
> Hey everyone, I’ve made a mod to increase the resolution and graphical quality of NMH3. This was all done with unreal engine commands through the game’s configuration file. This is honestly probably how it'll look if they release a PC port. There are different presets for the resolution and effects combo you want, but here’s what I’ve done for every mod option:
> 
> -Greatly increase draw distance quality in the open world and in general for all objects
> **---Note:** It will be a bit laggy when first loading into the open world because it is loading ALOT more all at once
> -Increase quality of all graphical effects to the normal max setting unreal engine uses for PC games (Bloom, depth of field, lens flares, ambient occlusion, etc)
> -Enable Temporal Anti-Aliasing with some custom tuning by me to fix jagged edges and image stability issues while maintaining sharpness
> -Increase texture quality to the highest the game has available
> -Increase texture quality transition distance (no more obvious line of blurry texture transition ahead of you when on the bike)
> -Enable x16 Anisotropic Filtering to increase texture quality at farther distances
> -Greatly increase the quality and render distance of shadows, including self-shadows on characters
> -Increase hair rendering quality and enable hair to cast shadows in normal gameplay
> -Increase lighting and shading quality and light render distance
> -Enable subsurface scattering for character’s skin
> **-(Optional)** Enable screen-space reflections for objects that support them (metal objects, cars, marble floors, windows, etc)
> **-(Optional)** Enable my own tuned per-object motion blur
> 
> **Some Previews:**
> Open World - <https://imgsli.com/Njk2MDA>
> Open World 2 - <https://imgsli.com/Njk2MDI>
> SSR Comparison - <https://imgsli.com/Njk2MDM>
> 
> **How to install:** Extract the file and you’ll see presets for the resolution and effect combo you want. MB=Motion Blur and SSR=Screen Space Reflections. Pick the folder for the preset you want and copy it to the game’s mod directory. For example, copy the "1440+MB+SSR" folder to the mod directory.
> 
> Unfortunately, it looks like per-object shadows (character’s limbs and hair casting shadows on the character themselves) get disabled during cutscenes, and the max fps in cutscenes is limited to 24-30 fps. The open world is also limited to 30fps. I wasn’t able to fix those with unreal engine commands. They would probably need someone going in and fixing it as an exefs mod. **Would be killer if someone could.**

> Got another test update for the No More Heroes 3 mod. Cleaned some stuff up, boots more reliably into the open world for me on both yuzu and ryujinx (still getting crashes every now and then), and actually found a way to increase shadow quality and character quality a bit more without performance loss. Again, don't have all the graphics presets there yet. If people could test and tell me how it works for them, that'd be killer.

> <@!810344082781634561> These will ideally be the final (or close to final) tests for stability. I've got all the graphical options dialed in exactly how I want them now. The number next to the "r" in the folder is the render pool size, and the number next to the "s" is the streaming pool size. If you could test them in the open world pls. My hypothesis is that no matter which render pool number you use, performance should stay mostly the same. It will be the changes in streaming numbers that'll really affect it. s630 is basically gonna look like the switch version. s650 is gonna look slightly better than the switch version up close but not at far distances. s800 should look the same as the mod has up until now. There's only one s630 folder because i expect performance on that one to be rock solid no matter the render pool size. Lmk how they go, thanks for all this. I'm off to bed lol.

> <@!810344082781634561> alright, if you could test these 4 presets out somewhat extensively and whichever one works best is what I'll upload as a new testbuild on youtube. On each folder, the first number is either a 1000 or -1. Thats the size of the streaming pool. I'm trying 1000 instead of 800 just to give the game a bit more wiggle room rendering wise and to see if it runs any better or worse. -1 makes it use unreal engine's default value instead, which I don't really know what that is but it makes the mod run about the same as 800 for me, so if that one doesn't have any issues I think -1 would be the value I'll stick with since its what unreal is built for. The second part of each folders name is either B1 or B0. This is whether uniformbufferpooling for the switch is enabled (1) or disabled (0). I honestly don't know what this does but the unreal documentation says to set it to 1 for more optimization and it came disabled by default with the game. I didn't notice any changes on my side with it enabled or disabled, but maybe it'll make things run better for other people. If not, I'll just set it back to 0.

> Threw the kitchen sink at it but couldn't get it to work. DoF is only available on certain cutscenes :/ Anyway, here is my newest draw distance 1 preset for 1440p and the WIP 60 fps patch by Kirby657Fan. It will only work for version 1.0.1 of the game. It actually doesn't have visual glitches anymore after restarting my computer, but it limits the whole game to 60 fps, including fights that had unlocked fps before. I asked him to look into that, maybe just unlock the whole game's framerate but we'll see. My yuzu mainline still crashes with the 60fps patch and draw distance 1, separate and together, but I'm at least able to load into the open world. Ryujinx runs like a dream though. Decided to disable the shader load at level start cause I was getting stutters in places I hadn't before and that was the only thing that could've caused them.

> **-----NO MORE HEROES 3 GRAPHICS MOD-----**
> -----BY NikkMann-----------------------
> -----Last Updated Sept. 12 2021 (V2)---
> 
> The mod comes in 2 versions, Normal and High Open World Distance. The only difference between them is how far out the open world renders,
> as that heavily affects performance. Everything else is exactly the same. If you are getting constant crashes in the open world, try the Normal version.
> 
> The recommended emulator is currently Ryujinx as you can completely eliminate all crashes by enabling the "6GB DRAM" and "Ignore Missing Services"
> settings for the emulator. Yuzu does not currently have any equivalent settings, so you WILL eventully crash in the open world on Yuzu. The 4k option
> also works just fine on Ryujinx, whereas on Yuzu it will either cause the open world to horribly misrender or crash instantly during load.
> If using Ryujinx, keep the resolution scale at Native, as my mod will completely handle the resolution.
> 
> **--FEATURES--**
> 
> -Greatly increase draw distance quality in the open world and in general for all objects (for the High Open World Distance version)
> ---NOTE: It will be a bit laggy when first loading into the open world because it is loading ALOT more all at once
> -Increase quality of all graphical effects to the normal max setting unreal engine uses for PC games (Bloom, depth of field, lens flares, ambient occlusion, etc)
> ----NOTE: Depth of field has a small issue when going above 720p (the game's default resolution). DoF is only used in cutscenes, and in certain sections of certain cutscenes it may be slightly off for a second or 2 because it was originally configured with the 720p resolution in mind. You probably won't even notice it, but if you think that things are a little more blurry than they should be for certain parts of cutscenes that use DoF, thats why. Nothing I can do to fix it.
> -Enable higher quality Temporal Anti-Aliasing with some custom tuning by me to fix jagged edges and image stability issues while maintaining sharpness
> -Increase texture quality to the highest the game has available
> -Increase texture quality transition distance (no more obvious line of blurry texture transition ahead of you when on the bike)
> -Enable x16 Anisotropic Filtering to increase texture quality at farther distances
> -Greatly increase the quality and render distance of shadows, including self-shadows on characters
> -Increase hair rendering quality and enable hair to cast shadows in normal gameplay
> -Increase lighting and shading quality and light render distance
> -(Optional) Enable my own tuned per-object motion blur
> 
> **--V2 CHANGES--**
> 
> -Offer Normal and High Open World Distance presets
> -Optimized streaming pool size. Should no longer instant crash when trying to load into the open world on Yuzu.
> -Fixed depth of field not rendering in cutscenes at all
> -Tuned roughness of screen space reflecions (SSR). Now only objects that should have SSR will have it, and everything that has it won't look like a polished mirror. SSR is now enabled by default on all presets. Thanks to cucholix on the GBATemp forums for finding the fix!
> -Further improved the distance at which detailed contact shadows fade
> -Further increased the quality of character rendering. Characters should now render at their max possible quality at all times.
> -Slightly tuned Temporal Anti Aliasing to be a bit sharper with less ghosting and eliminate shimmering
> -Slightly tuned Motion Blur to now not have any artifacting around Travis when moving the camera while running
> -Cleaned up alot of unnecessary commands
> 
> **Also checkout the FPS Unlocker mod above!**
>
